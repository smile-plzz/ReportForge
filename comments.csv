Attached is a spreadsheet showing the logic for free LAB GROWN diamonds with purchase of Designer Setting.

\*\*All credits and values are based upon a ROUND shape G VS2 quality.\*\*

If they select the standard G VS2 free lab diamond option we will select the round stone internally.

If they want a different SHAPE or QUALITY the logic would apply.

For customers that want to select their own lab diamond the calculation would be as follows:

A setting priced at 1000-1999 MSRP would qualify for a FREE 3/4ct. Lab center G VS2.

This would allow for any lab diamond they select that is over $600 to just pay the amount over that $600 price. If they pick something $600 or less of any shape or quality its free.

Same thing applies as the setting price increases and credit values increase as shown in the chart.

The actual credit values would remain in the background. Although the customer would be able to figure out the amount there is no need to actually promote the credit value.

Please let me know if you need further clarification at this time.

Hi guys! Hope you had a good weekend. Is it possible to add to the cart the current discount code that is applied, whether its added in the cart or applied automatically to all items/purchases? We have customers confused about our promotion because they see slashed out pricing but don't know where it is coming from without going to checkout.

Either at the bottom of the art above the price or on each line item, something like ""Code ""xxx"" applied (-$XX)

**Hi, thanks so much for reaching out — and no need to apologize for messaging on the weekend! We’re always happy to help you get the most out of Dynamatic.**

**FBT Slider Issue**
I went ahead and turned on the **Force Slide Per-View** toggle. Now it should be working properly — showing 1 slide for mobile and 3 for larger devices, just the way you wanted.

**Before You Go on Checkout**
This one wasn’t displaying because it was configured on a duplicate checkout profile instead of your live one. I’ve fixed that and added it to your live checkout, so it should now display correctly.

**Empty Cart Widget Customizations**
Since every store has its own unique design style, we don’t overload widgets with too many customization settings. Instead, we make it easy to handle styling through **Custom CSS**, which gives full flexibility. You can check all the CSS we’ve already written for your store here: [Custom CSS Settings](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/settings/custom-css ""‌"").


If you’d like to make further tweaks (like background or hover colors), you can either add them here yourself or simply share your requirements with us — even a quick design/mockup works. Our dev team is more than happy to write the code for you and make sure it looks perfect.

Really glad to hear you’re finding the app more user-friendly — that means a lot to us! Don’t hesitate to reach out with even the smallest requests, we’re here to make things smooth for you."

Are you already handling the shipping promotion setup directly in Shopify? If so, we can definitely support you on the UI side for the Canadian market specifically. For example, we can display a bar above the cart that clearly shows the promo — something like _‘Spend $50 more to get shipping at $10’_. So, customers would be able to see how much more they need to spend to qualify.

That way, your Canadian customers get a clear, tailored message about the promo, while your US customers won’t see it at all. Let us know if this sounds like what you had in mind, and we’ll be happy to set it up for you!"

We’ve carefully investigated the issue for you, and I want to reassure you that our widgets don’t interfere with Shopify’s core settings. Could you please confirm whether this happened with just a single order or across multiple ones? From what we can see, it looks like the bank may have canceled the second transaction for the upsell item. This is very rare, and none of our other merchants have reported something similar before.

One possible scenario could be that the customer’s account didn’t have sufficient funds for the upsell item, or there may have been another bank-related issue.

To get more clarity, we’d recommend reaching out to Shopify Support — they’ll be able to dig into the payment logs and confirm exactly why this occurred. Of course, if you need us to support that conversation in any way, we’re happy to help."

I've uninstalled Rebuy now, in case it was clashing, and linked it to a Campaign but I guess I'm missing something. (3) I like the idea of the empty cart widget but removed it because I couldn't get the customisations around background and hover colours to change, and it didn't look great. Even now, with the widget removed, I can't for the life of me see where to effect the background colour.

It checked two things:
1: If a Line Item Property VALUE contained 'CADPAT MT'
2: If the customer metafield 'checkout blocks.trigger' contains ""Canadian Forces""

If the line item property is present, but the metafield does not match, this should remove all payment methods, essentially blocking checkout.

This hasn't been working for a while but we've been doing some work and I can say for certain that the customer metafield is passing to checkout, as the warning for this that is setup in a shopify checkout block is working correctly.

Can I get you folks to look this over and make sure I haven't messed up a setting somewhere?

That works. We appreciate it! The name of the duplicate theme is Pitch - SImplified - for Dynamatic Cart Redesign

The goal with the redesign is to make things clearer for the customer, and to increase the scrolling space of line items and lessen the static objects

We're finding a lot of our drop off for conversion happening between add to cart and starting checkout and would like to improve that. We did some research on similar brands and have the following thoughts on what to change:

- Upsell no longer sticky, you should scroll down to find it
- Obvious that you need to scroll down: either an obvious scroll bar or a background that shows the page break
- Add badges for payment methods available at checkout under the checkout button
- Discount code visibility when a code is entered - use accents, bubble styling, etc, whatever looks good
- Change X button to “Continue Shopping” which would close the cart drawer
- Product Title Bold, variant Italicized to differentiate and make it clear what’s in their cart
- More dark colors- all the white is blending together. Possibly black background with white text where it makes sense?
- Discounted price should be our accent color (the red shade) to differentiate from slashed out price
- Upsell products should have slashed through prices
- The navidium widget shouldn't say ""Your order is protected"" and ""Checkout without protection"". Rather it should say ""Your shipping is protected"" and ""Checkout w/out shipping protection"" to alleviate customer concern regarding payment security etc.

The catch here is that we'll be having some maintenance done on our theme starting tomorrow morning and will not be able to edit until likely Tuesday. Are these changes something your team is able to work through today by any chance? If you want to duplicate the current theme to work on it that's fine, then let us know when we can preview it that would be great. Appreciate anything you can do with the tight turnaround!

‌

One additional note to this- we want to explore urgency widgets after this but not as high of priority. Designing with that in mind would be helpful though."

Thank you for your reply.

Great work so far on the cart - i am going to have a good play around with it and get back to you with anything we require.

The cart certainly is much quicker than previously.

There are some features i would like adding so i will once again, put together a word document for you to visualise what we would like.

Gemini generated custom widget requirement from the transcript-ed doc:

**Engagement Ring Bundle Offer:**

- **Logic:** When a customer purchases an engagement ring setting, they should be offered a free lab-grown center stone up to a certain category price, or a credit towards a more expensive lab-grown diamond, paying only the difference.
- **Pricing:** The value of the free diamond would be based on the listed price of diamonds in the database. If a more expensive diamond is chosen, the customer pays the difference (e.g., if a free diamond is valued at $2,400 and a $3,400 diamond is chosen, the customer pays $1,000).
- **Categories:** There would likely be five or six categories defining the value of the free diamond based on the setting's price. This logic would only apply to lab-grown diamonds, not natural ones.
- **Placement:** The offer should be prominently displayed on the product page, ideally before adding the ring to the cart, to incentivize immediate purchase.
- **Selection:** If the customer chooses the basic free diamond, the team will pick the diamond for them. If they want a larger or more expensive diamond, they should be able to select their own lab-grown diamond, and the logic should apply a discounted package price in the cart.

- **Free Gift Selection Functionality:**
  - **Logic:** Upon purchasing a certain item (e.g., a $5,000 bracelet), customers should be able to select a free gift from multiple predefined options.
  - **Options:** The system should present two or three predefined gift items for the customer to choose from, rather than allowing them to pick from the entire inventory.
  - **Action:** Once a customer selects a free gift, both the purchased item and the chosen free gift should be added to the cart, with the free gift's price set to zero.
  - **Current Status:** Ronnie B confirmed that while ""buy one get one"" (BOGO) functionality exists, the option for customers to choose from multiple free gift selections is not currently available out of the box but could be developed."

I turned it off because we're having a 25% off Sale that includes those items and didn't want want their price to drop so low. However, after I turned off the displays, I checked the checkout and it still showed up AND the price was not affected - should have totaled to be 75% off in cart, only calculated to the 50% off price. Not sure if that's an issue. The main thing for now is for it to not display at all during our sale, ends 9/30, then turn it back on when I need. Let me know how to do this.

That’s why it’s possible to add it to the cart when clicked.

We also confirmed that the variant string in the URL is updating correctly when different swatches are selected. Additionally, our widget is designed to be fully independent — it doesn’t rely on or modify theme code or functionality to work properly. We’ve verified that it does not show out-of-stock variants as available for adding to cart.

If you notice any exceptions, could you please share a screenshot or screen recording? That would help us identify and resolve the issue more efficiently."

Example go here:

This item in Midnight blue is actually not in stock but it is allowing the user to add to cart. I think this has to do with the fact that when I switch swatches it is not changing the variant in the URL string.

About the Campaign request, I think I am missing something.

I used Campaigns to add widgets to PDP and Checkout, but I didn't create a
campaign for the Smart Cart.
This is what I did for Smart Cart:

1. Created new widget ""Vetchy Tote Bag"" of type Free Gift
2. Enabled Dynamatic Cart Themes app embeds in Theme Customizer
3. Created a custom Cart Theme named Vetchy Static Cart
4. Drag & Drop the Vetchy Tote Bag widget in the cart
5. Published this theme live

and I see it visible.

Let me know if I missed any important details,

Thank you

Best,

content?

I am asking because I made some changes to the Widget text, and the first
time I did it, it took the text.
[image: image.png]

Then I changed the text and at the moment in the system we have this
[image: a04a2ec0-fa99-4742-a392-dff00f3996f2.png]

But when I preview the theme, it still shows the old text, even after
waiting 1h or more.

Thank you in advance,

The changes hadn’t been saved earlier — sorry about the inconvenience. Please check again now; adding product without any option should no longer redirect to the cart page.

P.S. We also noticed that **Rebuy Smart Cart** is still loading in the background. Running two carts at the same time can sometimes cause unexpected behavior and also hampers your website performance. If you’re actively using a specific Rebuy feature, let us know and we’ll be happy to replicate it within Dynamatic so everything runs smoothly. Looking forward to your thoughts!"

This was not caused by us. The theme settings were configured to redirect to the cart page. We updated that setting to “Dropdown,” and now the redirection no longer happens. So their statement that “redirect flow is still managed by your cart drawer app” is not correct.

For this issue, after checking, I see that when adding the Product to cart without any add-on options > the page is still re-directing to Homepage.
So for this issue, could you please help me to contact the Cart App to check again please?"

Hi Brian,

I have to admit it’s a bit frustrating to keep seeing automated or generic responses from them.

In their last message, they said: _“After removing the redirect code from your cart app, the cart drawer now works properly.”_ That’s misleading. As we explained in our earlier note, we identified exactly where the issue was, suggested the solution, and now we can see that they’ve implemented our recommendation. Yet they are still attributing the fix to “the cart app.” That simply isn’t accurate.

Now, regarding the new issues:

- **Redirecting to** `/cart` **page when no add-on is selected**
  This was not caused by us. The theme settings were configured to redirect to the cart page. We updated that setting to “Dropdown,” and now the redirection no longer happens. So their statement that _“redirect flow is still managed by your cart drawer app”_ isn’t correct.
  ![CleanShot\_2025-09-18\_at\_17.35.56.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66eaa3c31bbdc8cc5795866a/attachments/68cbeea8858e4feb405b62e8/download/CleanShot_2025-09-18_at_17.35.56.png)
- **Price mismatch issue**
  Here, we’re not sure what level of support they expect from us. Our cart simply displays whatever Shopify provides through the `/cart.js` script. We don’t modify this data in any way. From what we can see, the product option app is modifying the main item’s price by summing the options and attaching that to the cart drawer. However, when the quantity is increased, their app isn’t recalculating the sum correctly. This is entirely on their side — they need to ensure their “sum” logic runs again when quantity changes to keep pricing consistent."

Regarding the Buy X, Get Y Free widget, is there any way to do Buy X+Y, Get Z? Effectively we’d like to bundle certain products but instead of offering a discount, we’d like to try offering a free item instead – we’d be very keen on testing this approach to see if it works.

‌

Regarding the order number, thank you for the clarification – from the description of the app, when discussing the number of orders, I assumed it was the number of orders coming through the app, not Shopify orders in total.

‌

At the moment, we have budgeted only for the BASIC account – can we discuss remaining on this plan for the time being? We can assist with reviews or case studies, as we’re open to testing more and more features."

It is currently showing the amount payments would be if the product was full price, not the promotional price of $99.98. From what I can tell, this will involve editing the code of the shop pay widget. Is this something the team can help with? Our promotional pricing is displayed due to code changes we made in the price section, and it is based off the metaobject we have selected to tell it what discount to apply.

Hi Brian,

This is Vivian from AvisPlus Support.

Here’s the latest update from our dev team: After removing the redirect code from your cart app, the cart drawer now works properly (increasing product quantity no longer redirects to the cart page).

However, there are still two issues remaining:

1. If no add-on option is selected (no add charge option), the redirect flow is still managed by your cart drawer app. Please contact their support team to adjust this part.

1. When increasing the product quantity, the price is not updated correctly — it shows a mismatch instead of calculating the right total. To fix this, the cart requires a reload code. Could you please help us ask with the code from your cart drawer app so our dev team can review and adjust it for you?

Thank you very much for your cooperation. Please let me know once you get the code, and we’ll be glad to assist further.

Best regards,

Vivian | AvisPlus Customer Support"

This widget would appear directly on the cart page, showcasing items selected from our dashboard that complement the customer's selection. Given your focus on bridal sets, this is an excellent opportunity to recommend matching wedding bands, diamond stud earrings, or even a classic necklace that complements the style of an engagement ring already in the cart. This helps customers visualize a complete look and increases the overall order value.

‌

1. **Tiered Bar with Milestone for Free Shipping/Discount/Custom**


With high-value purchases like yours, shipping costs can be a significant factor. A tiered progress bar at the top of the cart could show customers how close they are to a free shipping threshold. This creates a clear incentive and can gently nudge customers to add a complementary accessory or a jewelry care kit to their order to reach the next tier, turning a potential objection into an opportunity for a higher average order value.

‌

1. **""Frequently Bought Together"" on the Product Detail Page (PDP)**


On a PDP, this widget would display items that other customers commonly purchase with the product being viewed. For example, on a specific engagement ring's page, this widget could show a simple diamond wedding band or a delicate eternity ring, making it easy for customers to build a coordinated set.

‌

1. **Interstitial Upsell for ""Add to Cart""**


When a customer clicks the ""Add to Cart"" button, an interstitial pop-up could suggest a related, higher-value item or a bundle. For instance, when a customer adds a diamond solitaire, the pop-up could present a bundle offer that includes a matching halo or a wedding band at a slight discount. This provides a last-minute opportunity to upsell before they proceed to checkout.

‌

1. **""Why Buy From Us"" on the PDP**


Your brand’s commitment to quality is a major differentiator. Placing a ""Why Buy From Us"" section on product page can be a good idea for building trust.

‌

1. **Trust Badges on the Cart Page**


Adding trust badges to the cart page, especially near the checkout button, reassures customers that their transaction is secure. Icons representing secure payment, data privacy, and a satisfaction guarantee can significantly reduce cart abandonment and instill confidence, particularly for first-time buyers.

‌

1. **Review Slider on the PDP**


Customer reviews are a form of powerful social proof. A review slider on the PDP, featuring testimonials from satisfied buyers, can build confidence and help potential customers feel more secure in their decision. Highlighting reviews that mention the quality, craftsmanship, and positive customer experience would be particularly effective.

These widgets, when implemented strategically, can transform your customer's journey from a simple transaction to a more engaging and confident shopping experience."

There seems to be a bug with Shopify's bundling app that duplicates variants if they are the same, causing our customers to get free additional products erroneously. It looks like the fix is to be applied to the cart line-item scripts. Does this make sense to you?


![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/68c11594aeeefe622d53a7b5/attachments/68c9984de355322b7b272f30/download/image.png)

‌

It is happening with bundles that contain two of the same items, only when the same variant is selected for each instance of that item. It will add a quantity of 2 of one instance of the item instead of a quantity of 1 resulting in customers getting a free item when they shouldn't. I THINK it only applies to one bundle we have right now, here: [https://www.strikeman.io/products/strikeman-pro-advanced-laser-firearm-training-system-gift-bundle?variant=44302829355181](https://www.strikeman.io/products/strikeman-pro-advanced-laser-firearm-training-system-gift-bundle?variant=44302829355181 ""smartCard-inline"") You can test it by selecting the same caliber for the first and bonus caliber, 9mm for example. You will see a total of 3 lasers added to cart, when it should only be 2. You can see it function correctly if you select a different caliber for the bonus option. I have included a screenshot of both examples. The one with the 40 S&W is functioning correctly. The one with 9MM twice is the problem.

Thank you for your update and the adjustments. I can confirm that passing the correct variant to the cart is working well.

However, I wanted to confirm that I currently do not see any difference yet on the live implementation regarding the pricing.

Just to clarify: the price of the variant should be calculated _per linear meter_. This was already the case before (you can also check how it works on the current site here: [https://www.rodelopers.com/nl_NL/tokyo-110-2m](https://www.rodelopers.com/nl_NL/tokyo-110-2m ""‌"")).

Additionally, the minimum length of the product should be set to 10 meters. At the moment, this still does not seem to be working correctly either.

Could you please confirm if these adjustments are already in place, or if further changes are needed?"

Hi Brian,

Thanks for passing along their message. We dug deeper into the issue and here’s what we found:

When any changes are made to the cart, a file called `apo-mini-cart-v3.js` is being fetched. As soon as that happens, the cart changes trigger a redirect to the `/cart` page.

To confirm, we recorded a screen capture showing the issue. Then, using dev tools, we temporarily blocked that specific file — and once it was blocked, the redirection stopped. This proves that the redirect is coming from this file alone.

We also downloaded and reviewed the file ourselves. Inside it, there’s an `updateCart` function which makes a fetch call to the `/cart/update.js?avismini=true` endpoint. In the second “then” block, there’s some custom code specific to different shops. Around **line 520**, we found the following snippet:

```
if (
  window?.routes?.cart_url &&
  window?.routes?.cart_url.indexOf("".js"") === -1
)
  window.location = window.routes.cart_url;
else window.location.href = ""/cart"";
```

As you can see, this explicitly forces a redirect to the `/cart` page.

We removed this redirection locally and overwrote the network request — and once we did that, the issue was fully resolved. I’ve attached a screenshot of the exact line of code for reference.

Please share this with their team and request that they remove or disable this redirection for your shop. That should permanently resolve the problem.

Thanks

I completely understand your confusion, and thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

The reason you’re not seeing the correct products in the widget preview is because of a **dashboard bug on our side**. This only affects the preview in the admin — on the actual post-purchase page it will display the correct products and apply the 25% discount as intended. Our team is already working on fixing this in the dashboard.

Regarding whether you need to replace your old widget: you actually don’t need to make any changes there. As I mentioned before, we’re now using a new feature called **Flow Builder** for post-purchase setups.

I’ve already gone ahead and created a flow for you inside Flow Builder (Tools > Flow Builder). You can view it directly here:
👉 [https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/flow/32](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/flow/32 ""‌"")

So no worries — everything is set up, and you don’t have to replace widgets manually.

Now you can go ahead and place a test order — if you add _Porch Balloon Pants_ to your cart, you should see _Luna Sleeveless Tank Top_ as the upsell, and vice versa."

Thanks for sharing all this detailed feedback — it’s super helpful. We’ve gone through each of your points and here’s where we’re at:

### **Single Product Carousel**

- **Add to Cart button**: This should now be working properly. Please test it again on your side.
- **Spacing between widgets**: This can be adjusted with custom CSS.
- **Limit product titles to 3 lines**: We don’t allow truncation by number of lines, only by character count. You’ll find this setting under widget customization. Currently, we’ve set it to 85 characters, but you can adjust as needed. For strict line-based truncation, custom CSS would be required.
- **Image alignment**: We’ve updated this via custom CSS so the product image aligns to the top of its title.

### **Cart**

- **Rounded product images**: Already handled with custom CSS — your images should now display with rounded corners.

### **Widgets**

- **Align product images to top**: Already done with custom CSS.
- **Rounded corners**: Also applied via custom CSS.

👉 To check all of the custom CSS we’ve applied, you can visit directly here:
[https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/settings/custom-css/](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/settings/custom-css/ ""‌"")

Since we work with hundreds of merchants, each with their own brand styles, it’s not possible to include every customization option inside the dashboard. That’s exactly where custom CSS becomes useful — it lets you achieve any look or behavior you want. And if you’re not comfortable writing CSS yourself, no worries! Our team of friendly developers is always happy to listen to your requirements and write the code for you. Don’t hesitate to ask.

### **Recommendations Across the Site**

We have multiple widgets you can use, including **Standard Carousel, Single Carousel, List Widget, Single Product, Frequently Bought Together, Interstitial Upsell, Volume Bundle, Product Recommendation, Collection Recommendation, Product Suggestions**, and more.

These can be placed on the homepage, product pages, cart page, blogs, checkout, and even post-purchase. All you need to do is:

1. Create the widget.
2. Create a placement zone and grab its ID.
3. Create a campaign with your desired audience and select the desired zone as well.
4. Insert the Zone ID wherever you want the widget to display (via the Dynamatic Zone app block).

If you’d like, we can walk you through this process step by step.

### **Tiered Rewards / Gifts Bar**

Based on your requirements, you have five milestones:

- $100: Free Shipping (with code)
- $150: $10 discount
- $175: Free gift (ebook)
- $200: $15 discount
- $300: $30 discount

We went ahead and configured the tiered bar for you. Since displaying all 5 milestones together didn’t look great, we included 4 of them in the tiered bar and added the **Free Shipping** as an **announcement bar** based on cart subtotal audience.

Everything should now be live for you to preview. Please take a look and let us know how it feels — we’re happy to tweak further until it matches your vision.

Thanks again for the detailed notes — they really help us fine-tune things for you!"

Hi,

Thanks so much for letting us know — I really appreciate you flagging this. We dug into it and here’s what we found:

- When a product with options is added for the first time, everything works fine. The product and options are added correctly, and the options remain hidden as expected.
- The issue only appears when you increase the quantity of that product. At that point, the cart briefly redirects to the **“/cart”** page before reopening the slide cart, which causes the flashing and disappearing effect (as shown in the Loom).

The reason is related to the **Avis Product Options** app. It’s built for a standard Shopify cart page, where updating quantity requires a page reload. On a slide cart, though, that reload isn’t necessary since the cart is already dynamic and updates instantly — which is why it feels disruptive here.

The best step is to reach out to the Avis team and let them know you’re using a slide cart. They’ll just need to adjust things so it doesn’t reload after changes like increasing quantity or removing products. And of course, if their team needs any help from our side, we’re more than happy to collaborate with them.

We want to make sure you and your customers have the smoothest possible cart experience, so please let us know how it goes.

Thanks for the feedback — it makes perfect sense.

Just to clarify, the **variant picker already doesn’t appear for products without variants**. You can double-check this in your cart now and see that it only shows up when needed.

Regarding the widget height, we understand what you mean. While we don’t currently offer a direct height adjustment, we do have different widget styles that naturally vary in layout and size. For example:

- **Standard Carousel** (what you have now)
- **List Widget**, which displays products in a simple horizontal list
- **Single Carousel**, which shows products horizontally in a sliding carousel

To help you visualize, we went ahead and configured **all of these widget options in your cart**. You’ll be able to see:

- List Widget
- Standard Carousel with 2 items
- Standard Carousel with 3 items
- Single Carousel

Please visit the preview URL and test them out. Once you decide which style works best for your brand and feels the most user-friendly, we’ll remove the others and keep only your preferred widget.

Preview URL: `https://se6ldluirjd2znls-6770655284.shopifypreview.com`

This way you can choose the option that looks the cleanest and fits your store’s flow best.

Thanks again for pointing this out — we really appreciate your eye for detail!"

‌

**Single Product Carousel (we've turned it off because the add to cart button isn't working)**

- add to cart button not working
- how to control the space between widgets in the cart better ie current space between carousel and our one time offer widget is too big
- how to limit product titles in carousel to 3 lines and truncate
- how to force carousel product image to align to top of its title rather than center?

‌

**Cart**:
How to make the product images have rounded corners?

‌

**Widgets**:
How to line the product image to top so that it aligns with the top of its title rather than center
How to apply rounded corners?

‌

**Other Questions:**
How to implement recommendations throughout the site ie home page, product pages, cart page, blogs etc.

‌

**How to implement a tiered rewards/gifts bar that includes a free shipping with code option that can be easily turned on/off when relavant to an active promotion? As follows:**

- Tiers for cash back at $150 ($10), $200 ($15) and $300 ($30)
- Free gift (ebook) at $175 (PDF download with auto add to cart? It's currently a variant of a product with 2 variants (paperback and ebook)
- Free shipping (during portions ONLY, with code) at $100 (ie ""You've Earned FREE Shipping! Use Code: DONNERDIDIT at Checkout!"")

a little UX feedback I think it would be more intuitive to default the mobile trigger to ""Hide"" with a note somewhere saying it's desktop-only

but we would still want to use this for desktop so any idea why all of a sudden its not working there anymore when it was earlier today?


feedback on the list widget (hoping we can address during the call)

1. not sure if it's because Im working in a dupe theme, but when I actually go to ""add"", it just spins & doesn't actually update or add anything to my cart (true on mobile + desktop)
2. I hav
   e the list widget set up to reference Feed #1 ""Accessories for all Men's Footwear"" where we want to offer 10% any accessory when you add to cart. The accessories I have included in this are (3) collections - socks, belts, & hats. I also have it configured NOT to limit the # of options shown, and to make it scrollable. However, when I go to test this I am only shown 5 products, whereas there should be a lot more. It's also not very intuitive that it's scrollable because there's no scroll bar or anything. Open to suggestions if there's a better widget to achieve the same goal, but wanted to send my feedback in the meantime

In the carousel, we'd like the ability to adjust the height of the item cards (or potentially change the orientation of the photos from landscape to portrait and vice versa as that would affect the height). Regarding the cart build, should we start a cart theme on our end or wait for you to create a matching cart like mentioned on the call?

Awesome, it looks good so far. Regarding the other requests, we offer some items which have variants to choose from and some that don't, and would like the variant picker drop down to not show up for the ones that don't, as it doesn't make sense to be there in those situations. The widgets look very tall so we were hoping to have some adjustability for the height of the cards/list items as well, which could include changing the orientation of the photos to landscape or just having a height adjustment. Hope that makes more sense!"

Do you have any docs that explains rules? I'm lost as to how the 2 rules you setup effect the widget.Like I said in my video here's my goal for this upsell:
\-If someone buys Porch Balloons Pants they are shown a Luna Sleeveless Tank Top upsell with a discount
\-Or, if someone buys a Luna Sleeveless Tank Top they are shown a Porch Balloon Pants upsell with a discountWhen I preview the widget you linked to it doesn't show either Porch Balloon Pants or Luna Sleeveless Tank Top in the preview (see attached). Should it show the correct products in the widget preview?I had previously setup a upsell called ""BFCM Post Purchase Upsell"" that lived in the campaign ""Non VIP Cart for November 13-26"" as an Experience called ""BFCM Post Purchase Upsell"" in the Zone ""BFCM Post Purchase Upsell"". I'm lost and don't remember why it's setup like that. If I want to use your new widget would I replace the current current widget in the campaign with the new upsell widget?

What I need is pretty simple :

- the entry point is the purchase of one of the bracelet of the collection.

  If you put the Classic in your cart you are offered upsell options : classic watch connectors and classic smartwatch connector. Ideally if you buy one, you pay full price, 2 you get 10% discount on the connectors, 3+ 15%

If you put the Shadow in your cart you are offered upsell options : shadow watch connectors and shadow smartwatch connector. Ideally if you buy one, you pay full price, 2 you get 10% discount on the connectors, 3+ 15%

If you put the Titanium in your cart you are offered upsell options : titanium watch connectors and titanium smartwatch connector. Ideally if you buy one, you pay full price, 2 you get 10% discount on the connectors, 3+ 15%

Then after the purchase, you can be offered a second Smartlet for 15% less (like you bought the classic and you are offered to buy a classic, a titanium or a shadow at 15% rebate

- i want to learn how to fully utilize the app so that I can make offers on my own. for example... i need to sell more red sweatres... how can i start to push the red sweater throughout the app so that dynamtic is selling more red sewaters in all the widgets
- i want to make better bundles for new products - for example we launch a new Collar and Leash... in rebuy - i have to manually go into the data source and make rules every time. is there a way to dynamically just show the new collar and leash combo ?
- run through each widget and see how each function works so that i can smartly utilize every aspect of the site
- we need to focus on mobile experience
- maybe go through some cosmetic changes on some widgets"

Thanks for the detailed update and for sorting out the points.

Next, I created a new widget that’s better suited for your requirements. You can find it here: [https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/widgets/4820/105](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/widgets/4820/105 ""‌"").

After that, I went into our **Flow Builder** (Tools > Flow Builder), which is mainly used to create Post Purchase Funnels, and set up a flow using this widget. Here’s the direct link to the flow: [https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/flow/32](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/flow/32 ""‌"").

Now, all that’s left is for you to go to your **Checkout settings** and select **Dynamatic** as your post-purchase page. Once that’s done, you can place a test order to confirm everything is working correctly.

If anything doesn’t look right, don’t worry — we’re here and ready to help you fine-tune it."

As you set the variants to 100cm and 200cm it will calculate wrong amount.

Thanks again for your support. After testing a bit further, there are still a few issues we’ve run into:

1. We created a new option set (for example on the Miami runner: [link](https://rodelopers.myshopify.com/products/miami-zand?_pos=3&_psq=miami&_ss=e&_v=1.0 ""‌"")), but it isn’t showing up on the product page.
2. When clicking the _“Winkelwagen Bekijken”_ (View Cart) button, it doesn’t actually take you to the cart (see screenshot attached).
3. When adding an item to the cart, the cart does not update.
4. When I add a 200 cm runner to the cart, the cart shows _Variant: 100 cm_ instead (see screenshot). The shipping costs are also calculated incorrectly based on this wrong variant.

Could you take a look at these points? Let me know if you need more details or if you’d like me to run additional tests.

I’m very sorry for the recurring issue — this isn’t something we usually encounter. It was caused by an unusual sizing of the close (X) icon.

We’ve fixed it by adding a custom CSS adjustment. You can see it here: [https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/settings/custom-css](https://dashboard.dynamatics.app/settings/custom-css ""‌"")

Here’s the CSS snippet we applied:

```
img.dyn-cart-close-image {
    width: 30px !important;
    height: auto !important;
}
```

This resolves the problem. After applying the change, we tested it thoroughly on iPhone 12 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and MacOS, and it now works as expected.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for the repeated issue and truly appreciate your patience as we worked through it.

Thanks

1. Can the product title be in our site's heading font (MADE Dillan)? If that's not possible then it should at least be Bold (but not both).

1. The Discount field is missing a $ dollar sign. 

1. The pricing & sale price is formatted plainly and it would be better to draw attention to the sale price/large discount.

My biggest concern is that the screenshot you're showing me doesn't match the dashboard preview - so when I'm setting these up I have no way of knowing what the customer will see if it's not going to match the preview in your dashboard. I'm not very comfortable launching something that requires me to place a test order every time I need to confirm if it's displaying correctly or not.

And lastly, I noticed that in my dashboard this post-purchase is still setup as both a Campaign and a Flow and I'm not sure which one is triggering here in your test.

I want it to be the Flow only so that way it shows the second upsell/downsell based on whether they accept or decline the first offer, and so I can easily configure a different primary offer if they already have the Mystery Blanket in their cart. 

That means I also need you to confirm that the entire post-purchase flow is working correctly and that each offer is displaying correctly with all the formatting issues.

I really hoped this was going to be a much easier process but it feels like your post-purchase experience still needs a lot of work to be honest. I appreciate your help in getting this to the level it needs to be to finally replace my Zipify app ASAP."

Hi [\@khushboo lad](https://ecompropeller.slack.com/team/U02L4TGE3UY ""‌""), the New Arrivals widget works dynamically — new products added to the collection will show up right away without needing a manual update. If you had a different area in mind, could you let us know? We may not be aware of it.

**khushboo lad**  
Hi [\@Samiul Alim](https://ecompropeller.slack.com/team/U05QJMA6LGH ""‌""),
Thanks for clarifying! Yes, the New Arrivals widget is dynamic on the homepage, but our concern is specifically with the **custom button** that redirects to the New Arrivals landing page.Currently, when clicking the button, the landing page does not automatically reflect the same products as shown dynamically on the homepage (we need to update the collection manually).What we’re looking for is a **dynamic connection** — so whenever the homepage New Arrivals section updates, the landing page also updates automatically with the same set of products, without any manual update required.Could you please confirm if this setup is possible or guide us on the best way to achieve it?Thank you!"

Thanks for the link. I will schedule a time through the link.

I would like to highlight a few points in the current setup that are not functioning as expected:

1. **Cart & Product Details (1)**
   At the moment, products are added to the cart in such a way that employees cannot see which specific product has been ordered. For example, when ordering _15 meters long and 1 meter wide_, the checkout only shows “15x” without any indication of the dimensions. This makes it unclear which product has actually been purchased. Ideally, the full product details (including size/dimensions) should also appear in the cart and checkout.
2. **Label Change**  **(2)**
   The current label for the order summary should be changed to **“Totaal”** instead.
3. **Remove Text**  **(3)**
   The text currently displayed under point 3 should be removed entirely. Unfortunately, I am not able to make this change myself.

Could you please let me know what options are available to resolve these issues?

Looking forward to your feedback.

I’m pretty sure, all pickup points we receive from our shipping provider will have “pakkeshop” in the name – so “name contains” should work. Thanks for making these corrections."
